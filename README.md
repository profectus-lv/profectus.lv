# Eleventy Chirpy minimal template by lastguru

A minimalistic Eleventy template, loosely based on [Eleventy Chirpy Blog Template](https://github.com/muenzpraeger/eleventy-chirpy-blog-template), inspired by [Chirpy Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy). It has been upgraded to Eleventy 3.0, significantly simplified and reworked, removing many features. Some features are new, some are reimplemented, and some more features will be reintroduced later. More cleanup and reworking is still needed.
