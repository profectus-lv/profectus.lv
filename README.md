# Eleventy Markdown Prime starter repository by lastguru

A minimalistic Eleventy starter repository for a text-based blog site, loosely based on [Eleventy Chirpy Blog Template](https://github.com/muenzpraeger/eleventy-chirpy-blog-template), inspired by [Chirpy Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy). It has been upgraded to Eleventy 3, significantly reworked and restructured, but keeping it simple and visually similar. Some features are new, some are reimplemented, and some more features will be reintroduced later. More cleanup and reworking is still needed.
